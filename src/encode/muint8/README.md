# MUint8

MUint8 is a module designed for efficient encoding and decoding of Uint8Arrays into a more compact format suitable for transport or storage. It provides functionality to compress and decompress data using a custom algorithm optimized for Uint8 data types.

- **Efficient Encoding**: Converts Uint8Arrays into a compressed format, reducing the size of the data for storage or transmission.
- **Decompression**: Allows for the decompression of the encoded data back into its original Uint8Array form.
- **Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly with JavaScript environments, making it easy to integrate with existing projects.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for encoding and decoding, requiring minimal setup and no external dependencies.
