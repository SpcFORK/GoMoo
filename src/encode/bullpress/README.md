# Bullpress

Bullpress is a sophisticated encoding and decoding library designed to optimize string data for storage or transmission. Utilizing a combination of techniques including Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Huffman Coding, and custom algorithms, Bullpress ensures efficient data compression.

## Features

- **Efficient Encoding**: Leverages BWT and RLE for initial compression, followed by Huffman Coding for optimal efficiency.
- **Custom Algorithms**: Includes unique encoding strategies such as Bracket Encoding to handle special characters and numeric data.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for encoding and decoding operations, making it easy to integrate into any JavaScript project.
- **High Performance**: Designed for high-speed processing of large datasets, with a focus on minimizing memory usage and maximizing speed.
